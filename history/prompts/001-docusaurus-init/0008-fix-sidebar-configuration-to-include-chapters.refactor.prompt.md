## Prompt

You misconfigured the sidebar. You only included the intro.md files, so chapters didn't appear. The fix is to replace the tutorialSidebar block in sidebars.ts with a version that uses autogenerated items for each module so all chapter-01, chapter-02 files load. Replace everything from "tutorialSidebar:[" to its closing bracket with the corrected snippet.

## Response snapshot

Fixed the sidebar configuration by updating the tutorialSidebar in sidebars.ts to use autogenerated items for each module directory, allowing all chapter files to appear in the sidebar navigation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Sidebar now properly displays all chapter files in each module, not just intro files
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: frontend/sidebars.ts updated to use autogenerated items for each module
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Using autogenerated items in Docusaurus sidebars ensures all markdown files in a directory are included without manual maintenance.
