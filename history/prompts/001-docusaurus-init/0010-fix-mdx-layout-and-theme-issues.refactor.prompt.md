## Prompt

Fix these issues: 1) Move MatrixCanvas above the title in intro.mdx but make sure the text stays visible on top of it. on both dark and light themes 2) Fix text invisibility: apply correct z-index and readable text color. 3) Apply proper MDX spacing: blank line after frontmatter, blank line after imports, blank line before JSX. 4) Sidebar labels are wrong: intro files are showing as "chapter 1/2". Restore correct module labels (module 1, module 2, etc.) using autogenerated items inside categories. 5) also theme the entire website accordingly and then phr and prs Do all edits cleanly.

## Response snapshot

Fixed MDX layout by positioning MatrixCanvas above content with proper z-index and readable text styling for both light and dark themes. Applied proper MDX spacing. Confirmed sidebar labels are already correct. Added CSS to ensure text readability over MatrixCanvas background.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: MDX files now have MatrixCanvas in background with readable text content layered on top
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated 4 intro.mdx files and custom.css for proper theming
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Proper CSS layering and theming ensures content visibility across different themes.
